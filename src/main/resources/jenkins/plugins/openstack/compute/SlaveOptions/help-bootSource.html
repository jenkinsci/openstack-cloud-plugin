<div>
  Selects the kind of image to be used as the boot source for the instance.
  <p/>
  OpenStack has multiple ways of storing the data necessary for booting up a new instances.
  This plugin supports the following:
  <dl>
  <dt>Image (default)</dt>
  <dd>
  A bootable filesystem stored on OpenStack's &quot;image store&quot; subsystem.
  Images get copied to the &quot;compute node&quot; before being booted.
  The instance is given a writable copy which is disposed of when the
  instance itself is destroyed.
  </dd>
  <dt>Volume Snapshot</dt>
  <dd>
  A bootable filesystem stored on OpenStack's &quot;block storage&quot; subsystem.
  Booting from a Volume Snapshot requires OpenStack to create a new volume
  for the instance to boot from, which will automatically be deleted when
  the instance itself is disposed of.
  </dd>
  </dl>
  OpenStack also supports booting from an
  &quot;Instance Snapshot&quot;
  or a
  &quot;Volume&quot;
  These methods are unsupported by this plugin but data can be converted,
  e.g. by creating a Volume Snapshot from a Volume.
