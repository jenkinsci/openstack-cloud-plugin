<div>
    The duration (in seconds) for which the plugin will remember errors encountered during provisioning.
    <ul>
    <li>
    If an error is encountered while provisioning an Instance from a Template
    then that template will be ignored for this duration,
    allowing Jenkins' subsequent provisioning attempts to use other (hopefully working) templates
    (potentially on other clouds, if configured).
    </li>
    <li>
    If an error is encountered while communicating with the OpenStack service
    that is not directly related to a specific Template
    (e.g. when asking the cloud how many containers it is running)
    then the entire cloud will be ignored for this duration,
    effectively taking out all templates within that cloud for this duration.
    </li>
    </ul>
    General guidance:
    <br>
    High durations (e.g. minutes) work well where
    there are multiple clouds/templates configured
    (i.e. Jenkins is not limited to just one source of build executors),
    allowing other cloud/templates to provide a means of running builds.
    <br>
    Medium durations (e.g. one minute) work well where
    the OpenStack service serves more than one Jenkins server
    as this will prevent Jenkins from &quot;spamming&quot; the shared OpenStack resource with failing requests.
    <br>
    A low (or zero) duration should only be used where
    the OpenStack service is not shared,
    not always reliable,
    and
    when there are no alternatives to the configured Templates.
    i.e. when Jenkins should simply re-try failing templates until they work.
    <br>
    <br>
    Defaults to 300 (5 minutes) if not set (or set to an invalid value).
    A value of zero disables this functionality (so that recent errors will not be taken into consideration when provisioning).
