 A user data script is a special key in the metadata service that holds a file that cloud-aware applications in the guest instance can access. For example, one application that uses user data is the cloud-init system, which handles early initialization of a cloud instance. <br />You can place user data in a local file and pass it through the parameter at instance creation.
