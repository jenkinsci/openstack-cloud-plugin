## Essentials

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkinsci/openstack-cloud-plugin/master/docs/config.png"><img align="right" width="300" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkinsci/openstack-cloud-plugin/master/docs/config.png"></a>
In order to provision new nodes when Jenkins load goes high,
administrator needs to configure *Cloud* and one or more *Templates* on
global configuration page. Cloud represents connection to particular
OpenStack project (tenant). In order to use several openstack instances
or projects, it is necessary to configure several Clouds in Jenkins.
Template can be seen as a definition of particular *kind* of node.
Template is the primary holder of all the attributes for OpenStack
machine to be provisioned (image, flavor, etc.) as well as for Jenkins
node (number of executors, etc.). Note the attributes
can be configured on Cloud level as well. Such configuration will be
then used as default for its templates. For example, if all nodes are
supposed to use the same key-pair there is no need to state it in every
template, it can be configured on cloud level and leave the filed blank
in the templates.

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkinsci/openstack-cloud-plugin/master/docs/options.png"><img align="right" width="300" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkinsci/openstack-cloud-plugin/master/docs/options.png"></a>
Aside from machine/node attributes, every template requires name, labels and
usage mode to be configured. Name will serve both as an identifier of the
template as well as a name prefix for Jenkins node and OpenStack machine
(that is why some limitations apply here). Labels field expects a set of
Jenkins labels that will be assigned to all nodes that the template
provisions.  The Usage field specifies whether nodes will be provisioned for
builds that have no label requirement (_Use this node as much as possible_)
or only if a build's label is present (_Only build jobs with label expressions matching this node_).
The combination of the Labels and Usage fields will be used to determine
which cloud and template to use to process Jenkins load. When there is a build with no label
requirements, any template where the Usage mode is '_Use this node as much as possible_'
can be used to provision the node. Builds with label restrictions
can trigger provisioning only on templates with matching label set. The
attributes at template level will inherit all global values (the value
in effect is printed under the field on hte config page). In case required
field do not have a default nor current value, it will be reported.

The exception is here is the *Instance Cap* field that determines the maximal
amount of machines to be running either per whole cloud or per template. This is
so one can limit the total number and number per individual template at the same time.

### User data

Every template can declare user-data script to be passed to
[cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to customize
the machine that is provisioned. Note that the image needs to support
cloud init explicitly.

Before the script is sent to OpenStack, plugin injects several values
using `${VARIABLE_NAME}` syntax:

-   **`JENKINS_URL`**: The URL of the Jenkins instance
-   **`SLAVE_JAR_URL`**: URL of the slave.jar - the agent executable
-   **`SLAVE_JNLP_URL`**: The endpoint URL for JNLP connection
-   **`SLAVE_JNLP_SECRET`**: The JNLP 'secret' key. This key authorizes
    to connect Jenkins agent process to a Jenkins computer. Note that
    referencing this in server user-data (and then using it to launch
    agent process) makes it exposed to any user or automation permitted
    to access the Jenkins agent (including running builds). Also, when
    OpenStack deployment uses metadata service, which it often does, it
    must be deployed in a way this is guaranteed not to leak. See
    [OSSN-0074](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OSSN/OSSN-0074) for
    further details.
-   **`SLAVE_LABELS`**: Labels of the corresponding Jenkins computer

### Reporting

Openstack plugin utilizes [Cloud Statistics](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cloud-stats) that captures failures and time trends of past provisioning attempts.

### Configuration As Code

Since version 2.46, [JCasC](https://jenkins.io/projects/jcasc/) is supported. Example:

### Tips and tricks

-   User can manually provision agent from particular cloud/template on
    *Manage Jenkins \> Manage Nodes.*
-   Plugin identifies OpenStack image/snapshot to provision by its name.
    The image can be updated/replaced in openstack and the plugin will
    not require update provided its name have not changed.
-   In case maximal instance number is specified on template level, the
    stricter of the two (global and template value) will be applied.
    Global value exists to ensure that the number of machines
    provisioned by plugin will not exceed certain limit. The template
    value can further restrict that at most N machines of given kind can
    be utilized at the same time.
-   Plugin can report maximal number of instances was reached while
    there is not adequate number of Jenkins nodes. It is because plugin
    inspects running OpenStack machines in order to cover machines being
    provisioned/deleted (that do not have Jenkins nodes) and instances
    that plugin failed to delete. In case the instance get leaked,
    please report that as a bug with all relevant FINE level logs
    attached.
-   On every agent provisioned by the plugin, there is an environment
    variable `OPENSTACK_PUBLIC_IP` declared with the public IP address
    allocated for the machine.

### Troubleshooting

#### Accessing logs

Plugin uses `INFO` and above levels to report things user should worry
about. For debugging, set it to `FINEST` - note the `ALL` level is not
sufficient to print these. To configure OpenStack plugin logging in
Jenkins UI go to *Manage Jenkins \> System Log \> New Log Recorder* and
use `jenkins.plugins.openstack.compute` as the logger name.

#### Access openstack client from [groovy console](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/script-console/)

Use `Jenkins.instance.clouds[0].openstack.@clientProvider.get()` to
access the openstack4j client. Users are discouraged to use this
anything else but querying the openstack (otherwise there is no way to
ensure plugin will work correctly). For older versions fo the plugin use
`Jenkins.instance.clouds[0].openstack.@client`.

#### User Data / Cloud init is not evaluated

The image might not support it at all or can fail executing it. Check
machine log in OpenStack for further details. Note that for now, there
is no guarantee the script will complete before machine is connected to
Jenkins and builds are started.
