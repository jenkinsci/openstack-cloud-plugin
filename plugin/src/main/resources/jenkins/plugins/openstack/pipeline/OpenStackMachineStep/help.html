<div>
    Creates an Openstack <code>machine</code>, from an already globally defined cloud name and template without registering it as a Jenkins agent.<br>
    This step has a third optional String parameter named scope specifying how long is the server expected to live:<br>
    <dl>
        <dt><code>run</code></dt>
        <dd>The booted machine will be kept alive whilst the current run is kicking. This is the default mode if no scope is defined.
        </dd>
        <dt><code>unlimited</code></dt>
        <dd>The booted machine will be kept alive forever. Mind the possible resources starvation at the OpenStack provider!
        </dd>
    </dl>
